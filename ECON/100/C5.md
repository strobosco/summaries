# Chapter 5

- **externality:** a benefit or cost that indirectly affects parties other than producers/consumers

- externalities interfere with economic efficiency of a market equilibrium

## Externalities and economic efficiency

### Types of costs & benefits

- **private cost:** cost borne by producer
- **social cost:** cost of producing, equal to private cost plus external cost (such as pollution produced)
- both are equal unless an externality interferes

- **private benefit:** benefit received by consumer
- **social benefit:** total benefit from consumption, private benefit + external benefits (such as college education)
- both are equal unless and externality interferes

### Types of externalities

|  | Positive | Negative |
| :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |
| Consumers | Riding buses | Second-hand smoke |
| Producers | Orchard pollen | Air pollution | 

### Market failure

- externalities deprive markets of an efficient level of output

- **market failure:** situation in which the efficient level of output is not produced

### Causes of externalities

- **property rights:** rights to have exclusive use of property, including buy/sell rights
  
- a market system functions well when property rights are guaranteed
- property rights guarantee equality between social/private benefits and costs
  
- property rights can be difficult to enforce, be incomplete or be absent (college education for example)
