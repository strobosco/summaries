# Chapter 5

- **externality:** a benefit or cost that indirectly affects parties other than producers/consumers

- externalities interfere with economic efficiency of a market equilibrium

## 5.1 Externalities and economic efficiency

### Types of costs & benefits

- **private cost:** cost borne by producer
- **social cost:** cost of producing, equal to private cost plus external cost (such as pollution produced)
- both are equal unless an externality interferes

- **private benefit:** benefit received by consumer
- **social benefit:** total benefit from consumption, private benefit + external benefits (such as college education)
- both are equal unless and externality interferes

### Types of externalities

|  | Positive | Negative |
| :---------: | :---------: | :---------: |
| Consumers | Riding buses | Second-hand smoke |
| Producers | Orchard pollen | Air pollution | 

### Market failure

- externalities deprive markets of an efficient level of output

- **market failure:** situation in which the efficient level of output is not produced

### Causes of externalities

- **property rights:** rights to have exclusive use of property, including buy/sell rights
  
- a market system functions well when property rights are guaranteed
- property rights guarantee equality between social/private benefits and costs
  
- property rights can be difficult to enforce, be incomplete or be absent (college education for example)


## 5.2 Coase Theorem

- **economic efficient levels:** all decisions have to be made balancing _marginal costs_ & _marginal benefits_
- **net benefit:** the resulting benefit from a decision, difference between costs and benefits of that decision

go to page 152 and read _The Economically Efficient Level of Pollution Reduction_
- the idea is that reductions reach a point where they are no longer rational

- when large parties are inolved in these decisions the **transactions costs** are high
- **transactions costs:** costs in time and other resources that the parties incur 

### Coase Theorem

<div align='center'>
If transaction costs are low, private bargaining will result in an efficient solution to the problem of externalities
</div>

- all parties must be aware of all the costs and benefits relevant to the decision
