# Chapter 3

- the market that will be used is a **perfectly competitive market:** a market in which:
  1. there are many buyers and sellers
  2. all firms sell identical products
  3. no entry barriers for new firms

## 3.1 DEMAND

- the most successful businesses are the ones that respond best to consumer demand
- a customer is limited by desire and ability (purchasing power)

### DEMAND SCHEDULES & CURVES

- **demand schedule:** table showing relationship between price and quantity demanded
- **quantity demanded:** amount a consumer is willing and able to purchase at a given price

| Price | Quantity |
| :-----: | :-----: |
| $2.50 | 3 |
| $2 | 4|
| $1.50| 5 |
| $1 | 6 |
| $0.50 | 7 |

- **market demand:** demand by all consumers (total demand)
- **demand curve:** curve that shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded

**LAW OF DEMAND**
<div align='center'>
HOLDING EVERYTHING ELSE CONSTANT, WHEN THE PRICE FALLS, THE QUANTITY DEMANDED INCREASES <br/>
THE DEMAND CURVE ALWAYS HAS A DOWNWARD SLOPE
</div> <br/>

- **substitution effect:** the change in quantity demanded that results because a change in price
  makes the good/service more or less expensive relative to its substitutes
- **substitute:** goods/services that can be used for the same purpose
- **income effect:** the change in quantity demanded because a change in price has an impact on a
  consumers' purchasing power
- **purchasing power:** quantity of goods a consumer can buy with a fixed amount of income
- these 2 effects occur simultaneously whenever a price changes
- **Ceteris paribus:** the requirement that, when analyzing the relationship between 2 variables,
  other variables must be held constant
- **increase/decrease in demand:** a shift of the demand curve
- **increase/decrease in quantity demanded:** movment along a demand curve

### VARIABLES THAT SHIFT DEMAND

- income
- prices of related goods, substitutes and complements
- tastes
- population & demographics
- expected future prices
<br/>

- **normal good:** good/service for which demand increases as income _increases_
- **inferior good:** good/service for which demand increases as income _falls_
- **substitute:** goods/services that can be used for the same purpose
- **complements:** goods/services that are used together

- **change in demand:** refers to the shift of the demand curve when one of the variables,
  other than price, changes 

## 3.2 SUPPLY

- **quantity supplied:** the amount a firm is willing and able to supply at a given price
- profitability rises with price

### SUPPLY SCHEDULES & CURVES

| Price | Quantity |
| :-----: | :-----: |
| $2.50 | 7 |
| $2 | 6 |
| $1.50| 5 |
| $1 | 4 |
| $0.50 | 3 |

- **supply schedule:** a table that shows the relationship betwenn price and quantity supplied
- **supply curve:** curving showing the relationship between price and quantity supplied

<img src="img/supcurve.png" alt="Demand curve" height="500" width="700"/> <br/>

**LAW OF SUPPLY**
<div align='center'>
HOLDING EVERYTHING ELSE CONSTANT, WHEN THE PRICE INCREASES, THE QUANTITY SUPPLIED INCREASES <br/>
THE DEMAND CURVE ALWAYS HAS AN UPWARD SLOPE
</div> <br/>

### VARIABLES THAT SHIFT SUPPLY

- prices of inputs
- technological change
- prices of related goods, substitutes and complements
- number of firms on the market
- expected future prices
<br/>

<img src="img/supshift.jpg" alt="Demand curve" height="700" width="500"/> <br/>

- **change in supply:** refers to the shift of the supply curve when one of the variables,
  other than price, changes

## 3.3 EQUILIBRIUM

- **market equilibrium:** condition in which quantity demanded = quantity supplied
- **competitive market equilibrium:** market equilibrium with many buyers and sellers

### SURPLUSES & SHORTAGES

| Surplus | Shortage |
| :-------: | :-------: |
| Q supplied<br/>><br/>Q demanded | Q demanded<br/>><br/>Q supplied|
| prices are cut | prices are raised |
