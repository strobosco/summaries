# Chapter 2

- scarcity requires trade-offs
- factors of production (economic resources) are scarce

---
## 2.1

- **production possibilities frontier (_PPF_):** curve showing the maximum attainable
  combinations of 2 goods with available resources and current technology. It is also
  a great tool to visualize opportunity cost

### GRAPHING A PPF

to see example of writing PPF go to page 44

### INCREASING MARGINAL OPPORTUNITY COST

- ppf's are **bowed outwards** so changes along it are not linear
- as you move down the ppf you experience **marginal opportunity cost** because increasing one
  production requires larger and larger decreases in the other
- we can see that increases (or decreases) have an upper bound, where they are no longer larger:

<div align='center'>
the more resources already devoted to an activity, the smaller the payoff to devoting additional resources to it
</div> <br/>

### ECONOMIC GROWTH

- **capital stock:** amount of machinery and other physical capital available in an economy
- at any given time, the total resources available to an economy are fixed (capital stock included)
- **economic growth:** outward shifts in the PPF represent it because they allow the economy to increase
  its production, can be caused by:
  - population growth
  - technological advancements

---
## 2.2

- **trade:** the act of buying or selling, can be direct or indirect
- trade allows us to go outside the bounds of PPF's, increasing both production and consumption

### Specialization and Gains from trade

view example on page 48 and 49 (explained much better than I coudl ever)

### Absolute advantage & comparative advantage in trade

- **absolute advantage:** the ability to produce more of a good/service than competitors, given the same resources
- **comparative advantage:** the ability to produce goods/services at a lower opportunity cost than competitors

<div align='center'>
THE BASIS FOR TRAFE IS COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE, NOT ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE
</div> <br/>

- specialization should occur on goods/services in which the individual, firm or country
  has a comparative advantage and trade for the other goods/services

---
## 2.3

- **product market:** market for goods or services
- **factor market:** market for factors of production (inputs for production), 4 types:

| Labor | Capital | Natural resources | Entrepreneur |
| :----------: |:----------: |:----------: |:----------: |
| all types of work | physical capital<br/>computers, tools, buildings | land, water, oil, raw materials | business operator |

### CIRCULAR FLOW OF INCOME

<img src="img/flowincome.jpg" alt="Circular flow of income" height="500" width="500"/> <br/>

- **households:** suppliers of factors of production, receive income from selling the factors
- **firms:** suppliers of goods and services, receive funds from selling to goods and services
- read Figure 2.6 on page 55
- things the model doesn't take into account:
  1. government activity
  2. financial systems for flow of funds
  3. trade (both in factor and product markets)

<div align='center'>
THE MARKET SYSTEM SUCCESSFULLY COORDINATES THE INDEPENDENT ACTIVITIES OF SO MANY HOUSEHOLDS AND FIRMS
</div> <br/>

### The Gains from Free Markets

- **free market:** market with few government restrictions, both in production and consumption
- FREE MARKETS ARE A BENCHMARK AGAINST ACTUAL ECONOMIES as governments intervene on all modern economies
- Adam Smith first argued that restrictionsreduce a countries income and wealth, thereby restricting the quality of goods produced
  
### The Market Mechanism

- the assumption must be made that individuals take actions that are most likely to make themselves better off financially
- when buying/selling, the motivation of financial reward usually provides the best explanation for actions taken
- customers' wants are flexible, thus the prices and firms have to be as well
- **relative price:** price of one good/service relative to other prices, good indicator for customer taste/preference
- **invisible hand:** Adam Smith's definition for how the market leads firms to provide consumers with the goods they want

<div align='center'>
firms respond individuallyto changes in prices by making decisions that collectively end up satisfying the preferences of consumers
</div> <br/>

### Legal basis of a Successful Market System

- **protection of private property**
- **property rights**
- **enforcement of contracts and property rights**
