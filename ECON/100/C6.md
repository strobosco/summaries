# Chapter 6

- **elasticity:** measure of how much one economic variable responds to changes in another economic variable

## 6.1 Demand Elasticity

- **demand elasticity:** impact of a change in price on the quantity demanded
- calculated as the percent change in Q divided by the percent change in P

### Examples

- elasticity of 2 means that a 1% increase in P causes a 2% decrease in Q
- elasticity of 0.5 means that a 1% increase in P causes a 0.5 decrease in Q

## Revenue and elasticity

|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Elasticity > 1 | revenue increases as price falls | elastic |
| Elasticity = 1 | maximum revenue | unit elasticity |
| Elasticity < 1 | revenue increases as price rises | inelastic |
