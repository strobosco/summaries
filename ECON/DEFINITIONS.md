# Chapter 1

- **scarcity:** unlimited wants exceed limited resources -> wants can't be fulfilled
- **economics:** study of the choices consumers make to attain their goals, given scarce resources
- **economic model:** simplified version of reality used to analyze real-world economic situations

- **market:** group of buyers and sellers of goods/services and the institution/arrangement that connects them

## 1.1 

<div align='center'>
PEOPLE ARE RATIONAL, PEOPLE RESPOND TO ECONOMIC INCENTIVES, OPTIMAL DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THE MARGIN
</div> <br/>

1. **people are rational:** consumers and firms use available information to achieve their goals

<div align='center'>
RATIONAL != BEST
</div>  <br/>

2. **people respond to economic incentives:** people analyze the costs and benefits of their actions
3. **optimal decisions are made at the margin:** _most_ decisions in life invovle doing a little more or a little less, they are not "all or nothing" decisions

<div align='center'>
the optimal decision is to continue an action until the marginal benefits equal the marginal costs: MC = MB
</div>

### SCARCITY DEMANDS THE EXISTENCE OF **TRADE-OFFS**

- **trade-off:** producing more of one good/service means producing less of another, as we'll see with [PPF's](#21)
- **opportunity cost:** measure of trade-offs in production, defined as "the highest-valued alternative that must be given
up to engage in that activity"

<div align='center'>
WHAT will be produced?
HOW will it be produced?
WHO will receive what is produced?
</div> <br/>

1. **WHAT** is produced is decided by the consumers and the people working within firms and government.
Consumers decide what to buy, thus deciding what will be produced. Firms/governments decide where to allocate
their resources for production.
2. **HOW** the goods will be produced is decided by firms. The trade-offs faced concern the allocation of resources.
3. **WHO** receives the goods and services depends on income distribution within the population. More income, more purchasing power.

### CENTRALLY PLANNED, MARKET, AND MIXED ECONOMIES

| Centrally planned economy | Market economy | Mixed economy |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| Economy in which the government decides <br/> allocation of economic resources| Economy in which the decisions of households and firms interacting <br/> in markets allocate economic resources | Economy in which most decisions result from the interaction between buyers and <br/> sellers, government intervenes in resource allocation |

- in a market economy firms have to follow the wants of consumers, or go out of business,
**consumers ultimately decide what will be produced**
- firms compete to produce the **highest quality at the lowest price**

<div align='center'>
WHO RECEIVES WHAT IS PRODUCED? -> THOSE WHO ARE MOST WILLING AND ABLE TO BUY THEM.
</div> <br/>

### EFFICIENCY AND EQUITY

- **productive efficiency:** good or service is produced at the lowest possible cost ->
  achieved with interaction between firms
- **allocative efficiency:** production is in accordance with consumer taste ->
  competition among firms and voluntary exchange results in most requests goods/services being produced
- **voluntary exchange:** situation where both buyer and seller are made better off by the transaction

<div align='center'>
ALL MARKETS PROMOTE EFFICIENCY, THEY DON'T GUARANTEE IT
</div> <br/>

- **inefficiency** can arise from a variety of sources
  - new product being produced
  - government interference

- **equity:** the fair distribution of economic benefits

### ECONOMIC MODELS (OR THEORIES)

- models are used to male economic ideas sufficiently explicit and concrete so they can be used to make decisions.

- in order to **develop a model**:
  1. decide on the assumptions to use
  2. formulate a testable hypothesis
  3. use economic data to test hypothesis
  4. revise model (if test fails)
  5. retain the model to answer similar questions in the future

- **behavioral assumptions** about a parties **motives** are at the base of these models
  - firms -> maximize profits
  - consumers -> maximize benefits/satisfaction

- **economic variable:** something measureable that can have different values (people employed in manufacturing)
- **hypothesis:** statement about an economic variable that is true or false
- **casual relationship:** the hypothesis concerns a relationship in which on event CAUSES an effect

### POSITIVE AND NORMATIVE ANALYSIS

- **positive analysis:** analysis of WHAT IS
- **normative analysis:** analysis of WHAT WILL BE

<div align='center'>
economics is about positive analysis, measuring the costs and benefits of different courses of action
</div> <br/>

- economics is a social science concerned with how decisions of individuals explain different outcomes

## 1.4

| Microeconomics | Macroeconomics |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| how households and firms make choices<br/>how they interact in markets<br/>how governments intervene/influenece | economy as a whole<br/>inflation, unemployment, and economic growth|

- many situations have both microeconomic and macroeconomic aspects

# Chapter 2

- scarcity requires trade-offs
- factors of production (economic resources) are scarce

---
## 2.1

- **production possibilities frontier (_PPF_):** curve showing the maximum attainable
  combinations of 2 goods with available resources and current technology. It is also
  a great tool to visualize opportunity cost

![Sample PPF](ppf.png)

### GRAPHING A PPF

to see example of writing PPF go to page 44

### INCREASING MARGINAL OPPORTUNITY COST

- ppf's are **bowed outwards** so changes along it are not linear
- as you move down the ppf you experience **marginal opportunity cost** because increasing one
  production requires larger and larger decreases in the other
- we can see that increases (or decreases) have an upper bound, where they are no longer larger:

<div align='center'>
the more resources already devoted to an activity, the smaller the payoff to devoting additional resources to it
</div> <br/>

### ECONOMIC GROWTH

- **capital stock:** amount of machinery and other physical capital available in an economy
- at any given time, the total resources available to an economy are fixed (capital stock included)
- **economic growth:** outward shifts in the PPF represent it because they allow the economy to increase
  its production, can be caused by:
  - population growth
  - technological advancements
