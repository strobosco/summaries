- **scarcity:** unlimited wants exceed limited resources -> wants can't be fulfilled

- **economic model:** simplified version of reality used to analyze real-world economic situations

- **market:** group of buyers and sellers of goods/services and the institution/arrangement that connects them

<div align='center'>
PEOPLE ARE RATIONAL, PEOPLE RESPOND TO ECONOMIC INCENTIVES, OPTIMAL DECISIONS ARE MADE AT THE MARGIN
</div> <br/>

1. **people are rational:** consumers and firms use available information to achieve their goals

<div align='center'>
RATIONAL != BEST
</div>  <br/>

2. **people respond to economic incentives:** people analyze the costs and benefits of their actions
3. **optimal decisions are made at the margin:** _most_ decisions in life invovle doing a little more or a little less, they are not "all or nothing" decisions

<div align='center'>
the optimal decision is to continue an action until the marginal benefits equal the marginal costs: MC = MB
</div>

SCARCITY DEMANDS THE EXISTENCE OF **TRADE-OFFS**

- **trade-off:** producing more of one good/service means producing less of another, as we'll see with [PPF's](#11)
- **opportunity cost:** measure of trade-offs in production, defined as "the highest-valued alternative that must be given
up to engage in that activity"

<div align='center'>
WHAT will be produced?
HOW will it be produced?
WHO will receive what is produced?
</div> <br/>

1. **WHAT** is produced is decided by the consumers and the people working within firms and government.
Consumers decide what to buy, thus deciding what will be produced. Firms/governments decide where to allocate
their resources for production.
2. **HOW** the goods will be produced is decided by firms. The trade-offs faced concern the allocation of resources.
3. **WHO** receives the goods and services depends on income distribution within the population. More income, more purchasing power.

CENTRALLY PLANNED, MARKET, AND MIXED ECONOMIES

| Centrally planned economy | Market economy | Mixed economy |
| :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| Economy in which the government decides <br/> allocation of economic resources| Economy in which the decisions of households and firms interacting <br/> in markets allocate economic resources | Economy in which most decisions result from the interaction between buyers and <br/> sellers, government intervenes in resource allocation |

- in a market economy firms have to follow the wants of consumers, or go out of business,
**consumers ultimately decide what will be produced**
- firms compete to produce the **highest quality at the lowest price**

<div align='center'>
WHO RECEIVES WHAT IS PRODUCED? -> THOSE WHO ARE MOST WILLING AND ABLE TO BUY THEM.
</div> <br/>

EFFICIENCY AND EQUITY

- **productive efficiency:** good or service is produced at the lowest possible cost ->
  achieved with interaction between firms
- **allocative efficiency:** production is in accordance with consumer taste ->
  competition among firms and voluntary exchange results in most requests goods/services being produced
- **voluntary exchange:** situation where both buyer and seller are made better off by the transaction

<div align='center'>
ALL MARKETS PROMOTE EFFICIENCY, THEY DON'T GUARANTEE IT
</div> <br/>

- **inefficiency** can arise from a variety of sources
  - new product being produced
  - government interference

- **equity:** the fair distribution of economic benefits
